Login System

This application aims to create a Login System for users. The application allows users to log in using their username and password and access their own personal page. Users can also create new accounts and update their existing accounts.

This application was developed using Python programming language and Flask framework. Some other libraries were used in the application, including:

Mailer: This library allows the application to send email messages.
random: This library enables the application to generate random numbers.
hashlib: This library enables the application to generate a hash for data, which is commonly used to encrypt passwords.
sqlite3: This library enables the application to connect to a SQLite database and perform read and write operations on it.
datetime: This library enables the application to manage time and date.
html: This library enables the application to convert texts into HTML-safe strings, to prevent malicious attacks through user input.

HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and JS were used to create the application interface using Jinja2 Template. This application can be run by installing the libraries mentioned above and running the Flask server. Data can be stored in a SQLite database or any other database supported by Flask.
